# Introduction

Welcome to the official [`FalconMC (org)`](https://github.com/FalconMC-Dev) docs, thank you for reading!

These docs are meant to cover all of the projects maintained by the `FalconMC` organization.
## Projects
The projects maintained by `FalconMC` at the time of writing are:
- [`FalconMC`](https://github.com/FalconMC-Dev/FalconMC):
    A standalone minecraft server that's aimed to be an afk, lobby and minigame server,
    focused on performance and plugins.
- [`DataCompatMC`](https://github.com/FalconMC-Dev/DataCompatMC):
    A `CLI` tool to convert schematics between versions as best as possible.
    This is also used to generate code for `FalconMC` where it needs to know
    about the different assets of the game.
- [`These docs`](https://github.com/FalconMC-Dev/docs):
    An attempt at providing up to date documentation as much as possible
    for the projects listed above, there is the
    [`stable`](https://wiki.falconmc.org/) and [`bleeding edge`](https://wiki.falconmc.org/dev/) documentation.

## Contributing
Please don't hesitate to help out if you have a good idea
or find a bug/detail that could be improved upon. I'm sure there is
plenty of things I missed so I appreciate anything a lot.
